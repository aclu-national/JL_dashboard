# Visualizing Police Violence in Louisiana
Git for the Justice Lab: Visualizing Police Violence in Louisiana dashboard. This git includes documentation for the project, the data, the scripts to clean the data, the cleaned data, and all other work associated with the project. 

## Description
The dashboard is split into two halves: Police Killing and Police Misconduct dashboard. Each dashboard will include facts, figures, text, and plots to describe the harmful aspects of policing in Louisiana.

## Mission
Louisiana is experiencing an epidemic of police violence that disproportionately impacts people of color. Our mission is to enhance public awareness and promote a deeper understanding of police misconduct in Louisiana. Through this interactive platform, we aim to inform the public about police violence incidents, including killings, by providing comprehensive data visualizations, with data sourced from Mapping Police Violence, the Louisiana Law Enforcement Accountability Database, and the 2020 U.S. Census.

## Data
- The police killing data is coming from Mapping Police Violence: https://airtable.com/shroOenW19l1m3w0H/tblxearKzw8W7ViN8
- The police misconduct data is coming from the Innocence Project of Louisiana: https://hub.wrgl.co/@ipno/r/data/refs/heads/allegation#preview
