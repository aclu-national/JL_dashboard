# Visualizing Police Violence in Louisiana
Git for the Justice Lab: Visualizing Police Violence in Louisiana dashboard. This git includes documentation for the project, the data, the scripts to clean the data, the cleaned data, and all other work associated with the project. 

## Description
The dashboard is split into two halves: Police Killing and Police Misconduct dashboard. Each dashboard will include facts, figures, text, and plots to describe the harmful aspects of policing in Louisiana.

## Mission
Louisiana is experiencing an epidemic of police violence that disproportionately impacts people of color. Our mission is to enhance public awareness and promote a deeper understanding of police misconduct in Louisiana. Through this interactive platform, we aim to inform the public about police violence incidents, including killings, by providing comprehensive data visualizations, with data sourced from Mapping Police Violence, the Louisiana Law Enforcement Accountability Database, and the 2020 U.S. Census.

## Methodology
Data on known killings by police officers were obtained by Mapping Police Violence and include crowdsourced data on killings by police officers that have been reported by the media beginning in 2013. The Mapping Police Violence data are sourced from the three largest crowdsourced databases on police killings in the U.S. (FatalEncounters.org, the U.S. Police Shootings Database, and KilledbyPolice.net). These data have been supplemented by additional research on the victim's race. More information on these data can be found on the Mapping Police Violence website.  The data that we use was downloaded from Mapping Police Violence on June 12th, 2023.

Demographic information was obtained from the 2020 U.S. Census. In the analyses presented here, the Black population includes individuals who identified their race as Black or African American alone or in combination with another race. The white population includes individuals who identified their race as white and their ethnicity as not Latinx.

Data on known misconduct by police officers were obtained by the Louisiana Law Enforcement Accountability Database and include public data collected from a range of law enforcement agencies including police departments, sheriffâ€™s offices, civil service commissions, and more. Most of the data is collected through public requests made under the Louisiana Public Records Act. Note that the quality of the data is limited by the quality of the recording and reporting capabilities of the agency and data limitations within LLEAD including holding onto records and extracting data from them. To learn more about how the data is collected and modified, you can visit their website or their GitHub page. The data that we are using was downloaded from LLEAD on June 20th, 2023.
