## Mission
Louisiana is experiencing an epidemic of police violence that disproportionately impacts people of color. Our mission is to enhance public awareness and promote a deeper understanding of police misconduct in Louisiana. Through this interactive platform, we aim to inform the public about police violence incidents, including killings, by providing comprehensive data visualizations, with data sourced from Mapping Police Violence, the Louisiana Law Enforcement Accountability Database, the FBI Crime Data Explorer, and the 2020 U.S. Census.

## Methodology
Data on known killings by police officers were obtained by [Mapping Police Violence](https://airtable.com/shroOenW19l1m3w0H/tblxearKzw8W7ViN8) and include crowdsourced data on killings by police officers that have been reported by the media beginning in 2013. The Mapping Police Violence data are sourced from the three largest crowdsourced databases on police killings in the U.S. (FatalEncounters.org, the U.S. Police Shootings Database, and KilledbyPolice.net). These data have been supplemented by additional research on the victim’s race. More information on these data can be found on the Mapping Police Violence website. The data that we use was downloaded from Mapping Police Violence on August 21st, 2023.

Demographic information was obtained from the [2020 U.S. Census](https://data.census.gov/table?g=040XX00US22,22$0500000&y=2020&d=DEC+Redistricting+Data+(PL+94-171)&tid=DECENNIALPL2020.P1). In the analyses presented here, the Black population includes individuals who identified their race as Black or African American alone or in combination with another race. The white population includes individuals who identified their race as white and their ethnicity as not Latinx.

Data on the number of officer were obtained from the [FBI Crime Data Explorer](https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#/pages/downloads). The Law Enforcement Employees dataset comprises annual data concerning personnel employed by law enforcement agencies, encompassing both officers and civilians. The Law Enforcement Agency names were cleaned using the [Law Enforcement Agency Identifiers Crosswalk, United States, 2012](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/35158/datadocumentation#) accessed through the University of Michigan on August 21st, 2023.

Data on known misconduct by police officers were obtained by [LLEAD](llead.co) through public records requests and include public data collected from a range of law enforcement agencies including police departments, sheriff’s offices, civil service commissions, and more. To learn more about how the data is collected, you can visit their website (llead.co) or their [GitHub page](https://github.com/ipno-llead).
