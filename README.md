# JL_dashboard
Git for the Justice Lab dashboard. This git includes documentation for the project, the data, the data cleaning, the adjusted data, and all other work associated with the project. 

## Description
The Dashboard is split into two halves: the Police Killing dashboard and the Police Misconduct dashboard. Each dashboard will include facts, figures, text, and plots to describe the harmful aspects of policing in Louisiana.


## Goal
The goal of this project is to increase the broader Lousianian understanding of police misconduct by informing the public of what is happening and providing them with the resources to form conclusions themselves. 

## Data
- The police killing data is coming from Mapping Police Violence: https://airtable.com/shroOenW19l1m3w0H/tblxearKzw8W7ViN8
- The police misconduct data is coming from the Innocence Project of Louisiana: https://hub.wrgl.co/@ipno/r/data/refs/heads/allegation#preview
