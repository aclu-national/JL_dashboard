# JL_dashboarde
Git for the Justice Lab dashboard. This git includes documentation for the project, the data, the scripts to clean the data, the cleaned data, and all other work associated with the project. 

## Description
The Dashboard is split into two halves: the Police Killing dashboard and the Police Misconduct dashboard. Each dashboard will include facts, figures, text, and plots to describe the harmful aspects of policing in Louisiana.

## Mission
Louisiana is experiencing an epidemic of police violence that disproportionately impacts people of color. The ACLU of Louisianaâ€™s Justice Lab conducted a research project to visualize police violence around the state. Our mission is to enhance public awareness and promote a deeper understanding of police misconduct in Louisiana. Through this interactive platform, we aim to inform the public about police violence incidents, including killings, by providing comprehensive data visualizations, with data sourced from Mapping Police Violence, the Louisiana Law Enforcement Accountability Database, and the 2020 U.S. Census. Explore the data, uncover trends, and join us in our collective efforts to foster transparency and change in law enforcement practices.
